#Python Operators

#Arithmatic Operators
print(10+20)#addition
print(10-20)#subtraction
print(10*20)#multiplication
print(20/10)#division
print(20%10)#modulus
print(15//4)#floor division
print(10**20)#exponential 

#Assignment Operators
a=20
a/=5#divide
a+=5#add
a-=5#subtract
a*=5#multiply
a%=5#modulus
a//=5#floor division
a**=5#exponential
print(a)

#Comparision Operators
print(19==4) #Equal
print(3!=4) #Not Equal
print(3>4) #Greater
print(3<4) #Less Than
print(4<=4) #Lesser or Equal
print(4>=3) #Greater or Equal

#Logical Operators
x=2
print(x<5 and x>8)#Return True if both the statements are true
print(x<5 and x<8)
print(x<5 or x>8)#Return True if any one of the statement is true
print(not(x<5 and x<8))#Reverse the output #i.e. if result is true than it will return false

#Identity Operators
a=[10, 20]
b=[10,20]
c = a
a.remove(20)
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(a is c)#Return true if both the variables are same object projecting to the same memory location
print(b is c)#it will return false bcoz b is not pointing to the same memory location as c even though both have same elements

 #Bitwise Operators
#They are used to compare binary numbers
$=> AND =>if both bits are 1,it sets each bit to 1  otherwise 0
| => OR =>if one of the bits is 1,it sets each bit to 1 
                                                    otherwise 0
^=> XOR =>if one of the two bit is 1,it sets each bit to 1
                                                    otherwise 0
#=> NOT =>Complement Operator=>It returns complement of the numbers

<< =>Zero fill left shift =>the binary number is appended with 0's at the end
<< => Right shift =>Right side of the bit is removed
